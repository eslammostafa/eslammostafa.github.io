I was playing dota today, like i just do everyday, but today i was unlucky
to play with two guys who were harassing me for being an Arab. There was nothing really, they just started to insult me and instult arabs just because of my name. One of the team said they are being racist and we are here to play DOTA, but they just kept talking and "LOL" they reported me inside the game because i am arab ! i didn't pay attention to them, but from the inside i was very angry of their behavior and i want to punch them in the face, and ummm punch them more tell i get satisfied, specially when they brought up palestine to the talk.

Have you ever met such a situation, what should be done?
